# PROJECT NAME:
Clustering-Antarctic-Penguin-Species
# GOAL:
Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means Clustering
# DESCRIPTION:
Unsupervised learning is a critical task in machine learning, and it plays a significant role in this project. The objective is to delve into the information about penguins by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques on a thoughtfully curated dataset. By conducting thorough data exploration, extracting meaningful features, and employing advanced algorithms, this project aims to uncover concealed patterns, clusters, and relationships that exist within the dataset.
